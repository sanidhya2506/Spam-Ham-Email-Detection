# Spam-Ham-Email-Detection

This project showcases my journey towards becoming a data scientist by developing a machine learning model for detecting spam and ham emails. Using natural language processing techniques, the model implements TfidfVectorizer for feature extraction and various classifiers for effective email classification. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my skills in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, contributing to my growth in the field of data science.
